This project implements a machine learning solution for lymphographic classification through four distinct phases. It begins with data collection and preprocessing, utilizing open-source datasets and performing thorough analysis. The second phase involves testing various models such as Random Forest, KNN, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting, evaluating their performance using metrics like accuracy and F1 score. The third phase focuses on model improvement through hyperparameter tuning, ultimately selecting the best-performing model (KNN with 87% accuracy). The final phase develops a user-friendly web application using Flask and HTML, allowing users to input data and receive lymphographic classifications based on the trained model. This comprehensive approach ensures a robust, accurate, and accessible tool for lymphographic analysis.
